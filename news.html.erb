                  <p>(Louisville, KY—August 2015) Whether you’ve always wanted to be Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash or dreamt of defeating the Joker, Cheetah or Professor Zody, a ticket to this SUPERPARTY guarantees a night of excitement! Reserve your ticket now for the 7th annual Big Screen Bash, a grown-up Halloween Party to benefit the American Lung Association. Produced by the civic advocacy group A Breath of Fresh Air, this lively and much anticipated event sells out early.</p>

                  <p>You’ll feel as though you’ve entered Gotham City as you are met by an array of Super Heroes.  As well as a four-course dinner, the evening will include:</p>

                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">

                    <li>Ty Lockhart’s photography station</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Guests are encouraged to come dressed in costume as their favorite Super Hero.  Your costume creativity may be rewarded also in the competition for best costume. We will award three prizes: best female, best male and best couple costumes.</p>
